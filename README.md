# Customer Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa and Flask

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a customer sentiment analysis system using RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art language model for natural language understanding, and Flask, a lightweight web application framework in Python. The system allows users to input text reviews, and it predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the input text.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **RoBERTa Model**: Utilize RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer-based language model, for accurate sentiment prediction.
- **Web Interface**: Interact with the sentiment analysis system through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Obtain real-time predictions for customer reviews submitted via the web application.
